# MedSynNet: A Modular Synthetic Healthcare Data Generation Framework

MedSynNet is an innovative framework for scalable synthetic healthcare data generation powered by artificial intelligence for biomedical informatics.

## System Architecture

MedSynNet consists of three core components:

1. **Hierarchical Hybrid Generator (HHG)**
   - VAE-based feature encoding
   - Refinement through diffusion model
   - GAN-based realism enhancement

2. **Federated Synthetic Learning (FSL)**
   - Privacy-preserving distributed learning
   - Cross-institutional model sharing
   - Federated model aggregation

3. **Self-Adaptive Data Quality Controller (SA-DQC)**
   - Automated quality assessment
   - Anomaly detection
   - Continuous improvement mechanism

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from medsynnet import HHG, FSL, SADQC

# Initialize model
model = HHG()

# For federated learning
fsl = FSL(model)

# For quality control
controller = SADQC()
```
